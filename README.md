OfficeTimeOut is a tool that logs:

1. Time In on the first unlock session of the day or the first time of the day the application was opened.
2. Time Out on the last unlock session of the day or the last time of the day the application was closed.

It also shows the Target Timeout for the day which is computed based on the required working hours of 9 hours 45 minutes and the need to meet this average on a weekly basis.
